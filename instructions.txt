Welcome to Boggle!

The aim of the game is to find as many words as possible until the time runs out.
When a letter is selected a word is built at the bottom of the screen. Press submit once you have chosen your word.
If the word is correct, you will receive points and the word will be added to the 'Guessed Words' list.

A valid word is built from letters that are next to one another. A letter is considered next to another if it is
in one of 8 possible directions; up, down, left, right and the 4 diagonals. Any given letter may be used only once
when building a word. Any word may only be spelt once, even if it appears in several valid combinations. Valid words
must have more than 3 letters and no more than 16 letters.

The 'message area' is an informative display area. Pay attention to the messages given.

Points are awarded for each correct choice. A corrected word is awarded with a number of points equal to the word's
length squared. For example, a word with the length of 5 will be awarded 25 points.

If you have run out of words, you may press the hint button. When this button is clicked. A word will appear in the
'message box'. Each hint deducts 30 points. Note that a hint is only worthwhile if the length of the word given is
 greater than 5 letters. A word that already has been found will not be given as a hint.

Enjoy!
The Maker.
